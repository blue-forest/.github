**Blue Forest** is a French company developing a new software language and providing access to an ecosystem of tools around it.

We called this language **drop'in**, and we decided to open source our foundations codebase to share our researches with the community.

Our final service is under development but we are currently working on a [WebAssembly compiler](https://github.com/blue-forest/dropin) with Rust as the main language. Our current priority is to create a stable version for compilation involving documentation and testing.

Language usage and contributions guides will gradually be uploaded. We are and will always be open to your contributions, thank you for your help !
